# Branch2Skeleton
This project introduces a method to extract skeleton from RGB synthesized branch point cloud. You can use this procedure to extract skeleton from point cloud, and obtain the procedure from the [link]().

## Video demo
A quick video demo of the algorithm can be [found here](https://youtu.be/cq_7MVMzZ90).
  
## Restrictions
- This procedure runs in win_x64
- Currently, only ASCII encoded .ply file is supported, you can use other tools to convert point cloud formats, such as [CloudCompare](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare).
- The branch point cloud size should be less than 20k points.
- The branch point cloud needs to be claer and its shape should be radial.

## Data avaible
You can obtain the sample point cloud data from the [link]().
